My research explores how platform transparency, artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity practices influence user decision-making in digital platforms.

I focus on:
- Generative AI and disclosure policies
- Crowdfunding platforms (e.g., Kickstarter)
- Micro-investment platforms
- FinTech governance and digital identity
- Analytical modeling & econometric analysis

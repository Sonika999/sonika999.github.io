### 👩‍🏫 Teaching Philosophy

I believe students learn best when education is:
- **Practical:** grounded in real-world challenges and datasets  
- **Inclusive:** supportive of diverse backgrounds and learning styles  
- **Dynamic:** constantly evolving with new technologies like AI, cybersecurity, and cloud platforms

My teaching integrates my experience in **IAM**, **Equity Research**, and **Cybersecurity** to help students see connections between theory and practice.

Welcome! I'm **Sonika Singhal**, a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems at Virginia Commonwealth University.

My research lies at the intersection of:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Digital Platforms

I apply econometrics, machine learning, and analytical modeling to examine how technology influences trust, transparency, and decision-making.
